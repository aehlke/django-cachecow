* Add full support for cached properties. This is problematic since we 
obviously can't add a method ("delete_cache") to a property. Needs a 
different design to handle this. Currently the only way to delete a cached 
property is to use a namespace.

* Add namespaced low-level get/set/etc. functions, so we can use the 
namespacing features of CacheCow without the decorators.
